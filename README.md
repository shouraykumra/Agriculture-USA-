What data depicts? This database contains statistics on four feed grains (corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats), foreign coarse grains (feed grains plus rye, millet, and mixed grains), hay, animal unit indexes of grain and roughage, rail rate indexes, and grain shipments. This includes data published in the monthly Feed Outlook and the annual Feed Yearbook reports. Here i will consider only four feed grains as proposed in the proposal.

# Proposal
Source for 1st csv (feedgrains): https://data.world/cdc2019/agriculture/workspace/file?filename=FeedGrains.csv Source for 2nd csv (projection): https://data.world/cdc2019/agriculture/workspace/file?filename=Projection2019.csv

Discovery of the data: I was always curious how much crops of different kind are created every year so i searching for agriculture related dataset on data.world website and settled with this dataset as it depicts the cost of four feed grains (corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats), foreign coarse grains (feed grains plus rye, millet, and mixed grains), hay, and related items.

FeedGrain.csv depicts information of the above listed crops over the years from 1948 to 2018 for each crop and shows its pricing yearly and monthly.

Projection.csv shows the value of each type from the year 2017 to 2029, this is called projection because this is just an assumption that production will increase over the years as it has increased since 1949.

Question asked of the dataset: how the prices of crops in the feedgrain dataset like: barley, oats, corns and sorghum varies anually over the years and also in the projection dataset how values of crops corresponding to the feedgrain dataset varies from 2017 to 2029 and check for the hike in prices over the years and also for the coming.

Hypothesis 1: Money generated from exporting the crops are more than importing the crops of each type.

Hypothesis 2: Value will increase from 2018 to 2029 of each crop which is listed in projection.csv. This hypothesis is based on assumption that production and demand of the crop increases each following year.

#Question

how the prices of crops in the feedgrain dataset like: barley, oats, corns and sorghum varies anually over the years and also in the projection dataset how values of crops corresponding to the feedgrain dataset varies from 2017 to 2029 and check for the hike in prices over the years and also for the coming .

Answer: 1) Value of Corn constantly increases but in other crops the values increase till early 90s then drops.

2) corn and barley increases from 2017 to 2029, whereas sorghum and oats show neither hike nor decline in values.

# Hypothesis

1) Hypothesis 1: Money generated from exporting the crops are more than importing the crops of each type. (True)

2) Hypothesis 2: Value will increase from 2017 to 2029 of each crop which is listed in projection.csv. This hypothesis is based on assumption that production and demand of the crop increases each following year. (Partially true as only values of corn and barley increases and other remain constant.)

# Knowledge gained

1) United states produce so much crops per year that it can supply enough crops to it's states as well as to other countries too.

2) United states will be producing crops constantly in the coming year with no decrease in their production.
